TEAM NAME: BeatHF 

NEED STATEMENT: A better way to reduce hospital readmissions for heart failure in non-hospitalized patients with heart failure to improve outcomes, improve quality of life, and reduce cost 

DESCRIPTION: Patients with advanced congestive heart failure have some of the highest readmission rates. Many of these readmissions are preventible if early weight gain symptoms are identified and treated with oral medications. Patients need help to optimize the self management of their condition.
